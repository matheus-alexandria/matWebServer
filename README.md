## Mat Web Server

In this project I'm creating a web server with nodeJS to undestrand more about how a connection works and the TCP model behaves.

This creates a promise based socket server with a pipelined steam, allowing multiple messages being send at once in the same connection.

I'm following a tutorial in the <a href='https://build-your-own.org/webserver/'>Build Your Own X</a> site and making my own changes while developing it.
